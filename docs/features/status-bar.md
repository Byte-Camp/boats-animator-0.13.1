# Status Bar

![Status bar](../img/status-bar.png)

The status bar contains useful information about the current project. The status bar is located in the [Main Window](/interface/main-window).

## Current frame

`Frame x of y`

This is an indicator of what is currently being displayed in the preview area. When in capture mode `x` is equal to one more than the number of frames currently captured. The logic here is: "once this picture is taken it will become the `x`th frame captured."

## Current FPS

`xx FPS`

This is the frame rate that will be used to playback frames. The playback frame rate can be adjusted using the **frame rate adjuster**.

## Current resolution

`0000x0000` or `No camera selected`

This is the current capture resolution. `No camera selected` is displayed when a capture device is yet to be selected in the sidebar.

## Current mode

`x mode`

This is the current mode that Boats Animator is in.

### Capture mode

This is when a live-feed of the selected camera is displayed in the preview area. Capture mode is accessed by selecting the **live-view button**.

### Playback mode

This is when a captured frame is displayed in the preview area. Playback mode can be accessed either by selecting a captured frame from the frame-reel or by selecting the play button.
